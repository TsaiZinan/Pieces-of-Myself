I'm Dan Kurtz Phalen and this is the  Foreign Affairs interview  today we're in a tripolar world so three  is more complicated than two and that  relationship is very difficult to manage  so what we have to be conscious of and  careful of is not to drive China and  Russia close together in a military  sense  General Mark milley has his work cut out  for him as chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff he's helping to guide U.S  strategy in Ukraine at the same time  he's trying to figure out how the United  States should navigate in a very  different world one where it is no  longer the sole superpower where tension  with both Russia and China is growing  and where for the first time in decades  it is all too easy to imagine a great  power War  thanks for doing this hey thanks Dan  appreciate it so let's jump right into  the subject that has no doubt dominated  most of your last year and will dominate  your next five months on this job what  do you expect a likely Ukrainian  offensive in the coming weeks to achieve  and what would the path be from a  successful offensive to a negotiated  outcome to this war  so I don't want to speculate on a  specific offensive or not what I will  say is that over the last several months  the ukrainians have asked us for  assistance military assistance to help  them to train to man to equip their  forces specifically about nine brigades  worth of uh combined arms armor and Mech  infantry type forces also there's some  light infantry Ranger type units that we  helped train and I say we I mean NATO  all of the European partners and we did  that so I would tell you that the  ukrainians right now have the capability  to attack they can conduct offensive  operations and they also have the  capability to defend significantly  enhanced from what they were just a year  ago for conventional operations so I  think their capability has significantly  increased so they can either do attack  or defend so I don't want to suggest  that they may or may not conduct an  offensive operation in the coming weeks  that'll be up to them you know they've  got a significant amount of planning and  coordination and all of that to do if  they were to do an offensive operation  but they're prepared to do offense or  defense  in the path from there to a negotiated  outcome what what's you you've stressed  again and again the need for this war to  end in a negotiation as has President  Biden president zielinski and many  others how do we get there given the the  assessments from senior U.S government  officials that Putin is not uh exactly  in a mood to negotiate at this point  I would say a couple things uh first  all wars do end sooner or later  and how the end really is the question  and in this case you know what what is  war about to begin with war is about  imposing your political will and your  opponent by the use of organized  violence and Wars happen when diplomacy  fails so when the Russians decided to  invade they had strategic objectives one  of their strategic objectives was to  collapse the zielinski government  capture the capital of Kiev to do that  relatively quickly advance from the  Russian border all the way the Juniper  River do that in a short amount of time  four to six weeks perhaps and then also  to cut off Ukraine's access to the to  the sea to the Sea of ASO by securing  kirison and Odessa very short order they  The Invasion started 24 February in very  short order Russia fell short of their  strategic objectives really within about  a month or so and the Russians could not  militarily achieve what they set out to  do and then what happens is is at the  end of uh March maybe beginning of April  in that time frame of last year Putin  Ridge us and resets his strategic object  and then he says I'm just going to limit  my objectives to the southern oblas  provinces of Ukraine and to consolidate  power in donbass secure the Crimea and  so on so he takes his entire military  shifts them further to the uh to the  South and to the East and then he  launches a second set of what I would  call operational objectives and and he  failed there as well so he has not yet  completely secure at the donbos he has  not yet achieved his operational  objectives down in that region and yet  you've got I don't know maybe 200 plus  thousand maybe 250 000 a large number of  Russian casualties killed and wounded  and he has replaced them with his first  tranche of mobilized reservist about 300  000 of those guys two to three hundred  thousand so there's still around 200 000  Russian troops poorly LED not well  trained poorly equipped not well  sustained in Russian occupied Ukraine  but they're there for the Ukrainian side  and about August time frame the  ukrainians launched two sequential  offenses one offensive counter-offensive  was up in the Carnegie region and then  it's Advanced across the river and it's  now really the front line traces in and  around caramina and they were very  successful in doing that and then they  launched a counter-offensive down in the  kirison region and they were very  successful in doing that so they have  two very successful counterfences where  they compelled the Russians to withdraw  and close their lines and re-establish  their defense and then things set in for  the winter and for the winter even  though there's been a lot of fighting uh  almost World War one style fighting  there's been very little change of hands  of significant pieces of territory with  the possible exception of Bak moot so  you've got essentially a situation along  a a front line that extends I don't know  probably Washington DC to Atlanta  something like that it's quite a ways  and that front line hasn't changed hands  it's essentially been stalemated and  then the ukrainians asked us for help to  build up their Force so that they had  the capability anyway of conducting  offensive operations with combined arms  maneuver with heavy forces mechanized  armor and infantry we've done that and  we have not yet seen what that's going  to result in you know this planning but  I'm not going to discuss that in this  form so we'll see then the question  becomes how does it end let's just let's  just say for the sake of argument that  there is an offensive and now you're  dealing in probabilities and speculation  which is always a dangerous thing to do  but I think that it's fair to to say if  there were on offensive that there's a  possibility of a variety of outcomes  clearly one of those outcomes could  achieve significant success and collapse  the Russian front line across the board  and that's happened before in previous  Wars World War One For example so  there's a possibility of that then  there's a possibility of partial success  as a possibility of limited success the  possibility of no success so all of  these are ranges of outcome if there  were an offensive operation then the  opposite is true I mean maybe maybe the  ukrainians go into a defensive operation  and the Russians would have great  challenge mounting an offensive  operations so we're going to see what  the future holds I do think though  that the probability of either side  achieving their political objectives  Wars about politics through the sole use  of military means I think that's going  to be very difficult very challenging  and frankly I don't think the  probability of that is likely in this  year but I do think that the Russians  have suffered a tremendous amount  they've lost a lot of casualties their  economy has been hurt significantly  their Ground Forces at least have  suffered enormously and I think that  rational folks is part of the Russian  decision-making process will conclude I  believe over either months or a year or  two they're going to conclude that the  cost exceeds the benefit and it will be  time to do something at least from a  negotiating standpoint that time maybe  not be now I can't read minds I don't  know when Putin will be ready to do that  but at a certain point if he's rational  he needs to do that he could he could do  it tonight he could end the war tonight  of course he has political constraints  internal to Russian politics but they're  gonna have to figure that out because  they're not going to win  if we look back a year ago it's striking  me that we were all thinking a lot about  escalation risks including nuclear  escalation risks that's not front of  mind for most of us maybe we're deleting  ourselves but how have you thought about  managing escalation risks in that Con in  this context and how is that shaped our  assistance Our advice to the ukrainians  or approach the conflict in general well  I think that it's in everyone's interest  not to escalate Russia does not want a  war with NATO or the United States and  NATO and the United States don't want a  war with Russia so it's in everyone's  interest in that regard and Ukraine  certainly doesn't want that scale of war  in its territory so it's in everyone's  interest not to escalate having said  that the possibility of escalation is  very real wars are highly emotional  there's a tremendous amount of fear  there's Pride there's interest there's  lucidities would tell us and all of that  is at play all at the same time in  varying degrees uh of inputs so the  possibility of escalation is always  there every single day we are always any  any action we take or any action we see  the Russians taking we are always  calculating the possibility of  escalation why because the consequences  of escalation are so severe and the the  consequences of armed conflict between  the United States and Russia or any of  NATO and Russia would be devastating  before both sides so it's in everyone's  interest not to have it we always  calculate it and we're always conscious  of any move and the possibility of  escalation we manage that as closely as  we can if we were talking about great  power War 18 months ago we'd be focused  on China One thing that has been  striking about the last year or so is  the growing closeness of of Russia and  China I'm curious how you see that  relationship where your assessment of  that relationship is especially in the  context of the war in Ukraine let me  look at what Xi Jinping wants to achieve  vis-a-vis the war and then is there  anything you see the U.S able to do to  prevent that from becoming an enduring  feature of the of the International  Security landscape unlike the Cold War  now you've got three great powers  in the world United States China and  Russia all have significant inherent  power potential in their populations or  economy and of course their military  and all three have substantial nuclear  arsenals so the United States is is the  most powerful by any measure but having  said that Russia and China are quite  powerful as well  so it is not in the U.S interest to see  Russia and China  form a strategic military Alliance and  we should do what we can to make sure  that that doesn't happen three is going  to be more complicated than two where  the Cold War relationship is between the  Soviet Union and the United States uh  you know and and there were other powers  that hovered around each of those two  countries  but it's really a struggle between the  Soviet Union and the United States  so as a bipolar world even though there  I acknowledge that there were other  powers today we're in a tripolar world  so three is more complicated than two  and and that relationship is very  difficult to manage so what we have to  be conscious of and careful of is not to  drive China and Russia close together in  a military sense there there's going to  be relations between countries so  competition is not the issue here the  issue is conflict and War so we want to  make sure that Russia and China don't  form some sort of geostrategic political  military alliance against the United  States there are some indicators out  there of China and Russia becoming  closer together I would say that they  bear watching very very closely uh  although it's not yet that geostrategic  military Alliance that we fear I  wouldn't say that it is yet it may yet  developed into that but we've seen some  economic assistance not strong in terms  of the military piece of this whatever  exercise that they do or  small relatively inconsequential I mean  they're not without consequence but  they're not huge military exercises  together in terms of military support  and lethal support to Russia nothing  really significant yet the Russians have  asked for sure they're asking a lot of  countries for ammunition and so on but  there's a relationship military  relationship with Iran and Russia for  example that's not good but with China  it's been very very modest and president  XI I would argue that he very very tough  guy hard guy consummate realist very  ruthless Chinese Communist Party very  ruthless but they are very realist in  the sense that they are keenly aware of  cost benefit and risk  and they too do not want outright armed  conflict with the United States they  recognize the Chinese do how powerful  the United States is despite what people  may say out there the Chinese are fully  aware of how powerful the United States  is and so they're not looking for that  kind of armed conflict either they want  to achieve their National objectives but  they want to actually do it without  armed conflict so we'll see where that  goes but we're not seeing yet a  full-fledged really cemented  long-lasting resilient geopolitical  alliance between China and Russia could  that happen in the future it could and  we need to be wary of that and we need  to do what we can to make sure that  doesn't happen when you look at the risk  of armed conflict in Asia you tend to  talk a lot about the need to do more to  deter China as you look at the war in  Ukraine and the lessons of that what are  you bringing to the the Pacific Theater  to concerns about just deterring China  and where do you think we need to be  doing when it comes to that deterrence  challenge given changing technology and  everything else the first thing to  remember is no two Wars are alike an  invasion of Taiwan by China is not going  to look like an invasion necessarily of  Ukraine by Russia the fundamentals are  different in in the sense that just the  terrain and the weather is obvious  you've got a landlocked country of  Ukraine with a land border with Russia  and Russia was able to mobilize and and  place into assimili areas and attack  positions for an invasion you know 140  000 150 000 troops just in the in the  lead echelons with another 100 000  behind them on multiple accesses of  Advance across a land border so then  they have ground lines of communication  Etc the Chinese problem is fundamentally  different in order to attack Taiwan they  would have to mount a uh amphibious  Invasion combined with paratroopers and  Air Assault rotary Wing helicopters  missiles uh all the prep fires that  would go into that they'd have to  isolate Beach heads and then have to  have the amphibious lift in order to do  that and cross basically 100 miles of  water of which is challenging in and of  itself then they it have to ensure that  the subsurface of the water was Secure  as well from submarine attack they'd  have to clear mines clear beaches that  have to go in and essentially attack and  seeds an urban area it's about three and  a half million people in a country  that's very mountainous and lends itself  to the defense so I would I would tell  you that you know be careful about  drawing straight line lessons or  conclusions I think one lesson though  that the Chinese are probably witting of  which is that real war is quite a bit  different than war on paper and when  real people are dying in real tanks and  infantry fighting vehicles are being  blown up and real friction is occurring  sometimes things don't go exactly the  way you may think they go so the Chinese  have not at least to our knowledge we  have not seen the level of training and  exercises that would be warranted to  conduct that size scale scope of an  invasion think about Normandy at  Normandy the United States and Britain  put about 120 000 troops ashore Plus  they dropped in three Airborne divisions  the night before and they put about 120  000 troops on the beach I think before  noon or by the afternoon and then do a  follow-on troops in the days afterward  now the Taiwanese military is not you  know the vermark of 1944 but it's not  zero either the Taiwanese military does  have capabilities that military that  landed at Normandy  had already done the invasions of North  Africa had done the invasion of Sicily  had done the amphibious operations in  Italy and they had the benefit of the  Lessons Learned of of probably 100 or so  amphibious operations in the Pacific  during World War II and they were led by  experienced seasoned leaders who were  hitting the beach Etc so that military  even as good as it was at the time in  1944 don't forget that Eisenhower wrote  a letter of resignation in the event of  failure the night prior and that was  over the English Channel which is  whatever it is 30 miles something like  that and now you're looking at 100 miles  with with a military that has never done  anything like that at all and to do that  and pull it off successfully even  against the Taiwan military which is not  the Vermont granted but the train is  much tougher much more complex Terrain  in Taiwan than it was at Normandy I  think it's a a real heavy lift and I  think the Chinese know that so what do  we do we need to deter armed conflict  and how do you deter we know through  history the way to deter is to have a  very very strong capable multi-domain  military and ensure that your opponent  knows that you have that capability that  that capability is overwhelming  knows that you have the will to use it  and you've communicated that to them so  what we need to do is make sure the  United States military is not only just  a little bit better but a lot better  it's overwhelmingly better than the  Chinese military to make sure that they  know it and that we have the will to use  it in the event of a crisis the other  thing that has to happen  I think is Taiwan needs to significantly  and rapidly improve their defensive  capability and this includes essentially  what you saw the ukrainians do which is  a nation at Arms the Russians aren't  just fighting the Ukrainian Army they're  fighting the Ukrainian people and you  need to kind of review your defensive  Doctrine and develop your military into  a capability that many strategists have  used the term porcupine strategy which  tells the Chinese that if you attack  you may achieve some limited success but  the cost is going to exceed the benefit  and the cost of attacking to seize  Taiwan would be extremely high and my  guess is we have a relatively limited  amount of time to ensure president XI  calculates like that and that's what  deterrence is about  we'll be back after a short break  did you know 5.8 billion people around  the world live under tyranny that's 72  percent of the world's population  it's June 13th to 15th the human rights  Foundation is hosting the Oslo Freedom  forum for the 15th year in Oslo Norway  The Forum is hosted in multiple cities  around the world bringing together Brave  dissidents human rights Defenders policy  makers artists technologists and more  all in the pursuit of making the world a  Freer place for all to learn more about  this and other upcoming events visit  Oslo freedomforum.com today  [Music]  it strikes me that you seem much more  assured in having this conversation than  the general environment in Washington  there's a line of argument that we in  the American policy debate have gotten a  bit hysterical about the threat from  China do you have concerns that we are  overreacting creating self-fulfilling  prophecies where do you where do you  think we are on assessing The Challenge  from China and how do you see the debate  here I kind of fall back to you know the  old saying from Teddy Roosevelt's time  right which is you know speak softly  carry a big stick that sort of thing and  that's where I think we should be I  think we should develop our military to  such a modernize our military to such a  degree that it is overwhelmingly obvious  to the Chinese that they cannot defeat  it so that's one thing and to make sure  that we do All the Right Moves  diplomatically economically Etc to  assure our friends and allies in the  region that we're going to be there and  we're going to help deter and prevent  Chinese military aggression but we're in  a period we're in a pivot point I think  we're in a pivot point anyway in terms  of what I've referred to in the past is  the character of War and what I mean by  that  is you've got the nature war and you've  got the character well the nature of War  arguably is immutable war is politics  that war involves fear and friction  uncertainty chance that's the realm of  the nature of war and as long as humans  are involved in war then I would say  those fundamentals about the nature of  War probably true so the nature of War  arguably won't change but the character  of War changes frequently so the  character War refers to the tactics the  techniques the procedures the  organization the weapons Etc and the the  character of War changes often every  time you get a software upgrade  technically the character of War has  changed somehow but the character War  only changes fundamentally once in a  while think the development of the wheel  and then also you got chariots think of  putting a bit in a horse's mouth and now  you have the development of Calvary  think about putting lands and grooves  inside a metal tube and you go from a  musket to a rifle the biggest  fundamental change that is commonly  cited historically is between World War  one and World War II where you get the  introduction of three Technologies the  airplane mechanization the the Wheeled  and tract vehicles and then those are  linked together through Wireless  Communications through radio so I would  argue that in today's world we are  undergoing the most fundamental change  in the character War ever in recorded  history and it's primarily being driven  by technology so what are some of those  Technologies well first of all you've  got Precision Munitions and you've got  ubiquitous sensors  so we can conduct long-range Precision  fires with greater accuracy at greater  range than at any time in human history  period  and it's not only us but the Russians  and the Chinese and other countries can  do the same and now we're seeing the  Advent in addition to long range and  precision you got the event of speed  hypersonics so you're introducing now  weapons they can travel at speeds that  essentially with today's defensive  Technologies are not defensible against  yet so you've got some fundamental  changes in the ability to shoot  you've also got fundamental change  happening in the ability to see so  anyone who wears a Fitbit or GPS watch  or runs around an iPhone that's a sensor  you know it's a means of communication  for most people and some track your  health I guess but for other people it  might be a sensor a Tracker so we have  an ability to sense and see the  environment and to pick up signals  because so much electronic signals in  the in the environment we have the  ability not just we Russians Chinese Etc  have the ability to see and sense that  environment like never before you can go  on Google Earth today and get map data  and see satellite imagery that was only  available to the world's most advanced  militaries as late as like five years  ago 10 years ago so our ability to sense  the environment is incredible so the  ability to see and the ability to shoot  and shoot at range with accuracy never  before like it is today just those two  fundamentals in and of themselves auger  a change in the fundamental you know  character four but throw on top of that  the rapidly developing technology of  Robotics we already use robotics uav's  unmanned aerial vehicles for example we  are now experimenting and developing  unmanned Maritime Vehicles both surface  and subsurface we're conducting  experiments with modern fighter aircraft  or bomber aircraft that will be  essentially unmanned you'll see in the  future trucks and tanks and ground  forces you'll see a very large  percentage of those will be unmanned so  robotics is coming very very rapidly  into all militaries much faster than  people may think throw on top of that  some other things the most important  most significant of which is the ability  to make decisions rapidly with great  accuracy so you could potentially  potentially see artificial intelligence  and Quantum Computing combined with  robotics become a dominant factor in the  conduct of War combine that with the  domains of cyber and space there's a lot  of things happening under sea and  there's about 20 other technologies that  I'm I won't go over but you've got this  convergence of technologies that is  driving fundamentally driving  significant change in Civil Society in  human relationship to work for example  art relationship to each other and  there's zeroed out in my mind that  that's going to have a huge impact on  the conduct of military operations in  the future and just like in the past  the country that optimizes those  Technologies for the conduct of warfare  that country is going to have a decisive  Advantage at least at the beginning in  the opening shots of the next War I want  that country to be the United States and  what needs to change about the way we do  strategy the way the US military  operates in order to prevent the Chinese  from Gaining that Advantage well there's  several things we've got to do what one  of the things we are doing is you have  to have a concept a concept of War  fighting at the same time you've got to  then also develop the warfighting  organizations that would execute that  concept once you figure that out you've  got to also figure out the Technologies  the weapon systems that these  organizations would employ in order to  successfully execute the concept then  you've got to figure out the human piece  what is the type of people the talent  management the training the skills the  knowledge the attributes that are going  to be required to be successful in that  operating environment so for example I  would argue that the future operating  environment will be be extraordinarily  more lethal than that which we've seen  in the past why because you can see  better  sense the environment better you can hit  it with Precision better  you can probably hit its speed uh with  with for example a Hypersonic weapon I  think it's also highly probable  that decision in future war will more  often than not occur in highly dense  urban areas and why do I say that is we  know that by mid-century we're going to  have something around the tune of about  maybe eight billion people in the world  we know there's something like 10 or 15  mega cities today defined as over 10  million people in the city we know that  mid-century at least the projections  that I've seen show that we'll probably  have something like 50 mega cities in a  mega City think about Seoul for example  it's a mega City where you got 27 or 30  million people basically from the  military zone all the way down to Osan  so you've got these massive Urban belts  think of Northern New Jersey and New  York City think of Rio De Janeiro these  are mega cities these are where people  are going to live and War will probably  shift to be conducted more in highly  dense urban areas than not so for  hundreds of years maybe thousands of  years the conduct of warfare has  occurred in armies and militaries have  been optimized to fight Wars in rural  area areas in deserts in the Rolling  Hills of Northern Europe that sort of  thing I would argue that decision in war  in the future will probably  fundamentally be decided in highly dense  urban areas we've seen some movie  trailers so to speak or some previews of  that in recent Wars the war against Isis  was decided in Iraq and mosul as an  example so in any given War  you're seeing the indicators the leading  indicators of the likely Technologies  the tactics the the techniques the  procedures that are going to get you do  you see them before that war starts so  as we move in to the next decade and  decades that follow  I would submit that the outcomes of War  will be decided fundamentally in urban  areas and the side that optimizes their  military to fight in urban areas that  optimizes the technologies that are  coming at us very quickly and the side  that basically gets their firstest with  the most is so to speak and has the  largest most capable force that that  optimizes those two things I think will  be successful and the last thing is in  order to be successful you have to  survive and because it's going to be a  highly lethal environment you're going  to be able to be seen what are some of  the attributes of a future force it is  entirely conceivable to me that a future  force will need to be lots of small  entities small organizations that are in  constant states of movement in order to  survive on a highly lethal Battlefield  and you'll have to be invisible either  through technology or through basic  cover and concealment sort of thing but  speed size and being nearly invisible  will be fundamental to survival on a  future Battlefield and we will have to  transform our or military we're not  going to throw the baby out with bath  water here 70 of our Navy is going to be  still with us 10 years from now 70  percent of the airport 70 in the Army  but about a third of that force will  need to fundamentally transform in order  to continue to outpace anything that  Russia or China can throw at us let me  close by stepping back even further the  historical perspective and you're a  student of History you know that it's  pretty rare to sort of go through a  period of you know many decades without  a great power War we've defied the odds  already with every passing year it seems  like the odds of that go up in ways that  must scare someone in your position  I I think that's true you know if the  World War II generation the last group  of people that fought a true great power  War they're passing very quickly I went  to Normandy a few years ago when I was  Chief Stephanie Army and I saw this guy  was a paratrooper from 82nd Airborne  Division he's in a wheelchair he's older  guy and I leaned over to him and talked  to him and I said so you know tell me  Sergeant what what was your lesson that  you want to tell Chief staff here on  what's your lesson from World War II and  I thought he was going to tell me  something about tactics or you know  three second rushes or how to shoot a  weapon or whatever and his eyes filled  with tears and he looked at me and he  said General never let it happen again  never let it happen again and my father  was very much like that as well there  were seven thousand Marines who died in  19 days on Iwo Jima where my dad landed  at Blue beach one thirty four thousand  wounded in 19 days at the Muse are gone  from October to November in in 1918 26  000 Americans killed in action from from  the B beaches of Normandy to the  liberation of Paris 26 000 Americans  killed in a short period of time not  even not even counting the the 40  million Soviet citizens the Russian  citizens who were killed in World War II  the 30 million Chinese the 20 million  Japanese 20 million I mean it's horrific  it's unbelievable so that memory is gone  from our day-to-day existence there's no  one in uniform in any military in the  world who experienced a great power War  there are no politicians currently in  office that I'm aware of that have  first-hand experience and it's  worthwhile to remember how horrific it  is and that all of us should recommit  ourselves to preventing such a horrific  catastrophe and try to resolve  differences in means other than the use  of the levels of violence that come with  great power war and we need to again  remember that the methods that have  worked in the past deterrence powerful  militaries capable military strong  militaries transmitting your will to  your opponent these are things that have  worked in the past and they're likely to  work in the future regardless of the  weapon system the monetization but but  we the United States if we do not meet  that challenge then it's going to be a  bad day and things are going to get  really rough in the not too distant  future I think we're up to that  challenge I think our country's up to it  I know our military is we're very very  capable and strong and ready right now  but we do have to make some fundamental  changes as we move forward well that is  a good note to end on General Millie  thank you so much for doing this thanks  Dan appreciate it  [Music]  thank
